# digamma

Ϝ, ϝ — digamma, used to be the sixth letter of the archaic Greek alphabet. The name “digamma” (δίγαμμα), is associated with the shape of the letter, “double gamma”. Originally, the letter was derived from the Phoenician “vav” (ϝαῦ), just like the Upsilon. In ancient times it was used in the system of Greek alphabetic recording of numbers with the value of 6, but later it was replaced by Stigma.
